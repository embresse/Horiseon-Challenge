# Code Refactor Starter Code
# <Horiseon Challenge>

## Description

For this challenge the motivation was to add HTML semantics, alternative text, and consolidate CSS for accessibility purposes. By adding HTML semantics to the index.html, the html now follows a logical structure independent of styling and positioning. By adding alternative text, it adds accessible alt attributes. The added title element will assist users when viewing or searching for this page. The consolidated CSS in the styling sheet allows for more concise and readable styling elements with notes attributing the different elements in the page for easier legibility and understanding.
